348.  Design Tic-Tac-Toe (Medium)
      Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n * n grid.
      You may assume the following rules:
      1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block
      2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
      3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
      
      Follow up:
      Could you do better than o(n^2) per move() operation?
      1. Could you trade extra space such that move() operation can be done in O(1)?
      2. You need two arrays: int rows[n], int cols[n], plus two variables: diagonal, anti_diagonal.
